                    Please read these Terms of Service (the

                    <nuxt-link to="policy">Privacy Policy</nuxt-link> carefully
                    because they govern your use of the website and the user

                    located at <nuxt-link to="/">https//sui.io</nuxt-link> (the
                    <strong>“Site”</strong>) and corresponding mobile
                    application (<strong>“App”</strong>) offered by Mysten Labs
                    Inc. (<strong>“Mysten Labs,” “we,” “our”</strong>), which
                    facilitates interaction with the Sui decentralized
                    cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control,
                    (the <strong>“Protocol”</strong>) allowing for activities
                    such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”),
                    blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market
                    makers, and wallets. To make these Terms easier to read, the
                    Interface collectively includes the Site and the App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mysten Labs does not own or control the Protocol. The
                    Protocol is maintained by the open source community and
                    unaffiliated third parties. As such, the Interface
                    specifically excludes the Protocol. Mysten Labs does not
                    undertake any obligations with respect to the Protocol. YOUR
                    USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

                    <strong>1. Agreement to Terms.</strong> By using our
                    Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
                    don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the
                    Interface. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some
                    jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of
                    this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of
                    certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a
                    case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent
                    permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may
                    have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and
                    nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you
                    may have as a consumer of the Interface under such
                    Applicable Law.

                    Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the
                    Interface, for information on how we collect, use and share
                    your information.

                    We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole
                    discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the
                    updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send
                    other communications. It’s important that you review the
                    Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If
                    you continue to use the Interface after we have posted
                    updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the
                    changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you
                    may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is
                    evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any
                    part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at
                    our sole discretion.

                    (d) The Software Package. The Interface uses the Protocol
                    paired with an open-source web framework (together with the
                    Protocol, the “<strong>Software Package</strong>”). You can
                    obtain the Software Package through GitHub. The Software
                    Package is available free of charge under the [insert
                    license] license (the “Third-Party License”). Although the
                    Interface is provided to you subject to these Terms, the
                    Software Package is provided to you under the Third-Party
                    License, and nothing in these Terms prevents or restricts
                    your use of the Software Package under the Third-Party
                    License. You are responsible for your compliance with such
                    Third-Party License. Furthermore, the Protocol is subject to
                    the Disclaimer found at [website address].

                    (e) <strong>Costs and Fees.</strong> Each party shall be
                    responsible for all Taxes imposed on its income or property.
                    In addition, interactions with the Protocol may also result
                    in transaction fees or Gas Fees (as defined below) imposed
                    by the Protocol, which are also solely your responsibility.
                    “Gas Fees” mean the fees that fund the network of computers
                    that run the decentralized blockchain network, meaning that
                    you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that
                    occurs via the blockchain network.

                    any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed
                    to restrict any rights that you may have to your User
                    Content.

                    rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in
                    your User Content under these Terms. You represent and
                    warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and
                    provision of your User Content to be made available through
                    the Interface, nor any use of your User Content by Mysten

                <p>
                    (d)<strong> Removal of User Content. </strong>
                    You can remove certain elements of your User Content by
                    specifically deleting it. You should know that in certain
                    instances, some of your User Content (such as posts or
                    comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies
                    of your User Content may continue to exist on the Interface.
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not
                    responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the
                    failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.

                    available to multiple users through any means.

                <p>
                    (b) <u> Additional Information: Apple App Store</u> This
                    Section 7(b) applies to any App that you acquire from the
                    Apple App Store or use on an iOS device. Apple has no
                    obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services
                    with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the
                    App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify
                    Apple, and Apple will refund the App purchase price to you
                    (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by
                    applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation
                    whatsoever with respect to the App. Apple is not responsible
                    for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating
                    to the App or your possession and use of it, including, but
                    not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim
                    that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or
                    regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under
                    consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not
                    responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
                    discharge of any third-party claim that your possession and
                    use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual
                    property rights. Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party
                    beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of
                    the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to
                    have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you
                    as a third-party beneficiary thereof. You represent and

                    country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government
                    list of prohibited or restricted parties. You must also

                    (a) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any,
                    Taxes apply to your transactions through the Interface.
                    Neither Mysten Labs nor any Mysten Labs affiliates are
                    responsible for determining the Taxes that apply to such

                    (b) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and
                    development of distributed ecosystems could negatively
                    impact the development of those ecosystems and related
                    applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the
                    potential utility or value of User Content or certain
                    digital assets.

                    you understand the inherent risks associated with using
                    cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you
                    have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of
                    tokens such as, bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other
                    digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token
                    Standard (ERC-20). You further understand that the markets
                    for tokens and NFTs can be highly volatile due to factors
                    including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation,
                    technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that
                    the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
                    blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase at
                    any time. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume
                    full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and
                    using and interacting with the Interface.

                    limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out
                    of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to or use
                    of the Interface, (b) your User Content, or (c) your
                    violation of these Terms. You may not settle or otherwise

                    Labs’s prior written approval.

                    ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO

                    (c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH

                    <strong>16. Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong>
                    These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed
                    by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration
                    law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard
                    to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise
                    expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the
                    exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that
                    you and Mysten Labs are not required to arbitrate will be
                    the state and federal courts located in San Mateo,
                    California, and you and Mysten Labs each waive any objection
                    to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>17. Dispute Resolution. </strong><br />
                    (a) <u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. We each agree
                    that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
                    relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
                    enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use
                    of the Interface (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved
                    solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a
                    class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
                    You and Mysten Labs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration
                    Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these
                    Terms, and that you and Mysten Labs are each waiving the
                    right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
                    action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination
                    of these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (b) <u>Exceptions</u>. As limited exceptions to Section
                    17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in
                    small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain
                    the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from
                    a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
                    misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (c) <u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The
                    arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
                    Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer
                    Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in
                    effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are
                    available at
                    <a href=" www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by
                    calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start
                    arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to
                    AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the
                    AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
                    <a href=" www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or
                    parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different
                    location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have
                    exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the
                    interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of
                    this arbitration agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (d) <u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing,
                    administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
                    AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration
                    and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless
                    the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail
                    in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and
                    costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you
                    prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of
                    attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under
                    Applicable Law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (e) <u> Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as
                    provided in Section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall
                    determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
                    asserted by either party and may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
                    seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
                    relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the
                    extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public
                    injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the
                    primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
                    threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to
                    and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court
                    of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The
                    parties agree that litigation of any issues of public
                    injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the
                    merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

                        PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong
                    >. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through
                    arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another
                    person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
                    preside over any form of a representative or class
                    proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
                    unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
                    section shall be null and void.

                        >Class Action Waiver</strong
                    >”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction
                    decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or
                    unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still
                    apply.

                    (b) <u> Entire Agreement</u>.These Terms constitute the
                    entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between
                    Mysten Labs and you regarding the Interface, and these Terms
                    supersede and replace all prior oral or written
                    understandings or agreements between Mysten Labs and you
                    regarding the Interface. If any provision of these Terms is
                    held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of
                    competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to
                    the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of
                    these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except
                    where provided by Applicable Law in your jurisdiction, you
                    may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law
                    or otherwise, without Mysten Labs’s prior written consent.
                    Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent
                    our consent or your statutory right, will be null. Mysten
                    Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without
                    restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind
                    and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors
                    and permitted assigns.

                    enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
                    considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver
                    of any such right or provision will be effective only if in
                    writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
                    Mysten Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms,
                    the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
                    these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
